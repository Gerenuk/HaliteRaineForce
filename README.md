# HaliteRaineForce

[Halite by Two Sigma competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite/overview)
I participated as a solo team "Raine Force".

* I shared my best agent, `raine_force_best_agent.py`.
    * I changed some lines from the actual submission to share. Mainly I deleted unused class and dirty comments. However, behaviors must be same as the actual submission.
    * Almost all comments are UTF-8 Japanese because I'm Japanese and my team is solo. I know that most of people cannot understand them, sorry.

## How to run (for people who did not participate the competition)

* prepare python 3.7 environment
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python run.py`
    * A json file and a html file will be created.
